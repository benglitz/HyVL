# HyVL - Hybrid Vocalization Localizer
The HyVL system relies on specific hardware and software for achieving high accuracy sound localization. We provide guides here for the hardware setup, documentation of the core functions and a sample data analysis pipeline. The present guide assumes that different labs will use different pipelines, programming languages and hardware components, and thus tries to describe general guidelines, rather than minutely reproduce our setup (which is documented in the publication).
